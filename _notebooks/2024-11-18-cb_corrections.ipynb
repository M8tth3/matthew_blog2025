    "- Overall there is a lot of room for improvement on College Board Topics. Some of the topics were fairly new to me, like recursion, however after some review of the quesiton I realize that I need to be more procedural when attacking the questions to ensure that I get the accurate answer. I also noticed  that for many of the questions that I got wrong, such as question 4 required me to pay attention to the smaller details of the code(question 4 defined its variables as integers, and I did not take into account that when doing integer division it does not output a decimal). I also noticed that I was tripped up a lot when it came to the indexing of arrays. Specifically, when a snippet of code used the array.length feature and I had to figure out if the code was valid, or if it would throw an error(e.g. question that involved k + a1.length -1 in a for loop).\n",
    "- Moving forward, I think it would be very beneficial to be more attentive to the declaration of variables in the code snippets (whether they're integers or some other data type) or class headers and think about how that may impact the result of the code.\n",
    "- Also need to work on the compound boolean expressions"
