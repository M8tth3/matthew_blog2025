    "Presenting our Digital Bathroom Pass System at Night at the Museum was a rewarding experience. We received valuable feedback from parents, teachers, and students, along with creative and insightful feature suggestions. One standout recommendation was to add a scanner outside the bathroom to verify that students actually reach the restroom after signing out — a great idea to further enhance accountability.\n",

    "What made the experience even more meaningful was knowing that this wasn't just a demo — the system is already up and running in our classroom. Seeing it actively used every day adds an extra layer of pride to what we’ve built.\n"
