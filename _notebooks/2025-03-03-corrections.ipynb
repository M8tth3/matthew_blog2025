I initially thought that it was iterating through each column and then going to the value in each column row-by-row. So it wasn't returning the row index with the largest value, it was returning the column index with the largest value in the 2D array. In the future I'm going to make it a point ensure that I'm careful about whether the for loops are iterating through columns vs rows. "

However, there is still room to grow, especially about being more careful when it comes to tracking the operators in loops--which were in abundance for this MC and being careful about retrieving values in a 2D array. Also, for some issues, even when I correctly identified a working solution, I missed alternative approaches--luckily the category breakdown for the college board quiz shows me exactly what I need to work on for the AP exam."
